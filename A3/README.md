**Assignment 3 FA23**

* Description: In this assignment, we developed a program named matrixmult_multiw that executes multiple matrix multiplications in parallel. This program reads a single A matrix and any number of additional W matrices as command-line arguments. Each pair of A and Wi matrices will be processed in parallel by spawning child processes that execute the matrixmult_parallel program. The results of these matrix multiplications, along with diagnostic messages, will be written to output and error files.

**Code:**

* **Important:** Compile the program "matrixmult_parallel.c" before compiling matrixmult_multiw.c to create "./matrixmult_parallel" which is used in matrixmult_multiw.c

* Compile this program first: gcc -o matrixmult_parallel matrixmult_parallel.c -Wall -Werror
	
* Then compile the program: gcc -o matrixmult_multiw matrixmult_multiw.c -Wall -Werror

**Test Cases:**

* Test cases are located in the A3/test directory.
* To run them, use the following command format: 
	./matrixmult_multiw test/[TestFileNameA] test/[TestFileNameW1] test/[TestFileNameW2] ... test/[TestFileNameWn]

**Test Case:**

**Input:** ./matrixmult_multiw test/A1.txt test/W1.txt test/W2.txt test/W3.txt

**Then:** There will be six new files create which are three somePID.out and three somePID.err files.

**Example Output:**

**Additional Information:**

To test for the last two lines of the Example Output, we intentionally introduced a sleep(100) command in the matrixmult_parallel.c program. This sleep command is used to simulate a situation where the matrix multiplication process takes a long time to complete. By doing this, we can demonstrate how to handle situations where a matrix multiplication process needs to be terminated manually.

Inside the matrixmult_parallel.c program, locate the point in your code where the matrix multiplication computation occurs. Insert the sleep(100) command at this location, instructing the program to pause execution for 100 seconds, simulating a time-consuming operation. Recompile the matrixmult_parallel.c program after making this modification.

Run the matrixmult_multiw.c program as you normally would, providing the appropriate input matrices as command-line arguments. When you observe that the matrix multiplication process initiated by matrixmult_parallel.c is taking a long time to complete, open another terminal window. In the new terminal window, use the "killall matrixmult_parallel" command. This command will terminate all running instances of the matrixmult_parallel program. If you have multiple instances running due to matrix multiplication tasks, this command will terminate all of them.

As a result of forcefully terminating the matrixmult_parallel process, you will receive a message stating "Killed with signal 15" in a specific PID.err file. Please note that the sleep(100) command was added for testing and demonstration purposes only. In practice, the matrix multiplication processes should ideally complete in a reasonable time frame, and manual termination should be unnecessary.

**Average Runtime (We ran the program 3 times using the time command):** 0.0423 seconds
